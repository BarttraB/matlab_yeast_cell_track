Tracking Analysis Protocol 

1. before using the code for the first time, you will need to recompile the mexModWillsMetric.c into a Matlab .mex file. To do this go start matlab and in the directory where that file is type the command >mex mexModWillsMetric.c  
If this fails you'll likely need to google around and figure out which c compiler to install that is compatible with your version of matlab. 

2. open cell_tracking_nogui_BBexpt12.m to edit. Make an output directory where your results will be stored. Modify lines 15-27 to point the program to the correct directories. Lines 29-34 should be adjusted to the properties of your image acquisition (see comments in code for explanation of what each parameter means). 
You can also change the minimal length of trajectories that are stored, cutoffL on line 73. At the moment cutoffL = 400 meaning that all trajectories that are less than 400 frames long will be thrown out.  


3. run the code  cell_tracking_nogui_BBexpt12.m and be patient. :)  It will output images of what cell is what object in each frame, called , CompositeColorXX.tif, in your output directory). Look through these and see if at least some cells are being tracked. If not, then you can either: change the segmentation parameters to make better masks (see segmentation instructions), or change the parameters like parameters.AvCellBox=31; %for 60X on line 90 ov getParameters_v5.m-or the scoring parameters on the lines below 90. 


4. the trajectories of objects are written to the file output_trajs_XXX.mat. The most important variable here is FluorTraj, which for each trajectory contains the times, object number, fluorescence {Mean, Local Mean, Area,  Standard deviation (Std),  MeanTop50, AreaTop50, StdTop50, MeanTop25(clrn), AreaTop25, StdTop25}. You will likely just want the time and fluorescence mean. 

5. As for plotting the fluorescence trajectories in Matlab I have included an example code, plotter_expt12.m,  with some sample output figures in the 'expt12_aug8_2014_Ti2/begin001/plots' folder.
