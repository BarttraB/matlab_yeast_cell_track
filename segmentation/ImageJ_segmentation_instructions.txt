1. threshold ( "Image" -> "Adjust" )

2. binary, convert to mask  (then you can cut the unnecessary regions)   ("Process" -> "Binary")

3. invert   ("Process" -> "Binary") (Edit > Invert)

4. watershed  ("Process" -> "Binary")

5. tracking particle ->  show in ellipses   ("Analyze")

6. invert  ("Edit")

7. erode  ("Process" -> "Binary")

8. tracking particle -> show in mask  ("Analyze")


always save mask  images with 'mask_' in their names.
